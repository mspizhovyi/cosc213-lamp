# Lab – Functions and Arrays in PHP

**Student Name:** Maksym Spizhovyi  
**Student ID:** 300 362 869  

## Overview
In this lab, I practiced using PHP functions and arrays to solve small programming tasks.  
The goal was to understand how functions can make code reusable and how arrays can store and organize data.

## Part 1 – Functions Practice
I created a few simple functions to print messages, do calculations, and handle input safely.  
This helped me understand how parameters, return values, and conditional checks work in PHP.

## Part 2 – Arrays Practice
Here I worked with both indexed and associative arrays.  
I learned how to find the largest and smallest numbers, add and remove items, merge arrays, and count repeated values using built-in PHP functions.

## Part 3 – Combining Functions and Arrays
In the last part, I combined both concepts.  
I wrote functions to calculate an average score and assign letter grades to students, and then used them to analyze a small class dataset.

## What I Learned
This lab helped me get more comfortable with PHP syntax and logic.  
I learned that functions make code easier to read and reuse, and arrays are really useful when working with groups of values.  
Overall, it was a good exercise to build confidence with basic PHP programming.
