# 🍕 Lab 10 — Food Ordering Basket in PHP

**Student Name:** Maksym Spizhovyi  
**Student ID:** 300 362 869  

This project implements a simple food ordering basket using PHP sessions.  
The base files were provided by the instructor, but I built, ran, and tested each part locally to understand how it works within the MySql Database.

I tested all actions:
- Adding items to the basket  
- Updating and removing items  
- Clearing the basket  
- Simulated checkout  
- Data persisting it tables correctly
